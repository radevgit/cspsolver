# Step 2.4 Complete: Additional Callback Method Fixes

## Additional Achievement: Fixed All Callback Methods

During Step 2.4 implementation, we discovered and fixed a critical issue where all `*_with_callback` methods were bypassing our optimization system and going directly to traditional search, causing hanging issues.

### Fixed Methods:
- `minimize_with_callback` - Now uses Step 2.4 → Step 2.3.3 → search fallback
- `minimize_and_iterate_with_callback` - Now uses optimization first  
- `maximize_with_callback` - Inherits fix through minimize_with_callback
- `maximize_and_iterate_with_callback` - Inherits fix through minimize_and_iterate_with_callback

### Impact:
- **No more hanging** on precision 6 callback methods ✅
- **0 nodes, 0 propagations** when optimization succeeds ✅
- **Consistent behavior** between regular and callback methods ✅

This ensures all optimization methods properly utilize our Step 2.4 precision handling infrastructure.
